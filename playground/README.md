# Reyna Playground

A browser-based playground for the Reyna programming language.

## Features

- **Code Editor**: Syntax-highlighted textarea for Reyna code
- **Examples Gallery**: Pre-built examples for key features
- **Share via URL**: Share code snippets with base64-encoded URLs
- **Dark Theme**: Modern, developer-friendly design

## Usage

### Local Development

1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Write or load example code
3. Click "Run Code"

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

Full browser execution requires packaging Reyna as a Python wheel for Pyodide. The current version demonstrates the UI and examples but runs code locally.
